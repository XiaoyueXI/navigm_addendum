# navigm_addendum
Supplementary code accompanying the paper:

A modelling framework for detecting and leveraging node-level information in Bayesian network inference (2023). Xiaoyue Xi, Hélène Ruffieux.

The repository contains scripts for simulation experiments that assess the performance of navigm and its robustness to hyperpriors on network sparsity and data generation scenarios. Additionally, we provide the code for the application to the monocyte expression network.
