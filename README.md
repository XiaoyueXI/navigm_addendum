Supplementary code accompanying the paper:

A hierarchical framework for inferring and leveraging node-level information in Bayesian networks (2023). Xiaoyue Xi, Sylvia Richardson, Hélène Ruffieux.

The repository contains scripts for the simulation experiments and sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of [navigm](https://github.com/XiaoyueXI/navigm) to the choice of hyperparameters controlling the prior mean and variance of the network sparsity and data generation.
